# **RayTracer - CUDA C++**

A GPU-accelerated Ray Tracer implemented in **CUDA C++**, based on *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* by **Peter Shirley**. The project leverages GPU parallel processing to efficiently render scenes with multiple materials, anti-aliasing, and realistic lighting.

## **What I Used**

- **CUDA C++** for GPU acceleration  
- **Ray Tracing in One Weekend** as the foundation  
- Custom implementations for:  
  - Lambertian (diffuse) materials  
  - Metal (reflective) materials  
  - Camera and ray generation  
  - Anti-aliasing for smooth image quality
